# Linked Lists

Learning linked lists by manually building them. 

## Description

To learn Linked Lists, we made our own LinkedList and Node classes to manually create and manipulate nodes. 

## Approach

The LinkedList class instantiates a list and sets the default value for the head. This is also the entry point for adding nodes.

When insert is called, LinkedList creates a new Node via the Node class and updates the head of the list appropriately. 

We also implememnted methods for print (returns an ArrayList of all list values), and includes (checks if a value is in the list).
